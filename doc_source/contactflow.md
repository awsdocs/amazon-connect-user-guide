A contact flow defines each step of the experience customers have when they interact with your contact center\.

You can create a contact flow using the contact flow templates provided\. You can also create your own contact flow from scratch, using the **Create contact flow** editor\.

The following template types are available:
+ **Customer queue flow**—Manages what the customer experiences while in queue, before being joined to an agent\. Customer queue flows are interruptible and can include actions such as an audio clip apologizing for a delay and offering an option to receive a callback, leveraging the **Transfer to queue** block\.
+ **Customer hold flow**—Manages what the customer experiences while the customer is on hold\. With this flow, one or more audio prompts can be played to a customer using the **Loop prompts** block while waiting on hold\.
+ **Customer whisper flow**—Manages what the customer experiences as part of an inbound call immediately before being joined with an agent\. The agent and customer whispers are played to completion, then the two are joined\.
+ **Outbound whisper flow**—Manages what the customer experiences as part of an outbound call before being connected with an agent\. In this flow, the customer whisper is played to completion, then the two are joined\. For example, this flow can be used to enable call recordings for outbound calls with the **Set call recording behavior** block\.
+ **Agent hold flow**—Manages what the agent experiences when on hold with a customer\. With this flow, one or more audio prompts can be played to an agent using the **Loop prompts** block while the customer is on hold\.
+ **Agent whisper flow**—Manages what the agent experiences as part of an inbound call immediately before being joined with a customer\. The agent and customer whispers are played to completion, then the two are joined\.
+ **Transfer to agent flow**—Manages what the agent experiences when transferring to another agent\. This type of flow is associated with transfer to agent quick connects, and often plays messaging, then completes the transfer using the **Transfer to agent** block\.
+ **Transfer to queue flow**—Manages what the agent experiences when transferring to another queue\. This type of flow is associated with transfer to queue quick connects, and often plays messaging, then completes the transfer using the **Transfer to queue** block\.

## Contact Block Definitions<a name="contact-blocks"></a>

Contact flows are created in the contact flow editor using action blocks arranged by dragging and dropping them onto a grid\. The contact flow configuration is grouped into blocks\. Each group represents a specific action, and each block has editable conditions related to the group’s action or behavior\.

**Note**  
When you set **User Defined** or **External** values in dynamic attribute fields, ensure that you use only alphanumeric characters \(A\-Z, 0–9\) and periods\. No other characters can be used\.

### Interact<a name="contact-interact"></a>


| Block | Action | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  **Play prompt**  |  Plays a stored audio file, or delivers a Text\-to\-speech message\.  |  Prompts can be an audio file, stored in the prompt library, or text\-to\-speech, which can optionally be specified in a flow via a contact attribute\. If you use text\-to\-speech, you can use a maximum of 1,024 characters\.  | 
|  **Get customer input**  |  Branches based on customer intent\.  |  Plays an interruptible audio prompt and branches based on DTMF or Amazon Lex intents\. If you use text\-to\-speech, you can use a maximum of 1,024 characters\. Amazon Lex bots support both spoken utterances and keypad input when used in a contact flow\.  | 
|  **Store customer input**  |  Stores numerical input to contact attribute\.  |  Plays an interruptible audio prompt and stores digits via DTMF as a contact attribute\. To enable encryption, contact your system administrator to add a public signing key to the **Contact flow security keys** settings of your Amazon Connect instance\.  | 
|  **Loop prompts**  |  Loops a sequence of prompts while a customer or agent is on hold or in queue\.  |  When **Loop prompts** is used in a queue flow, audio playback can be interrupted with a flow at preset times\.  | 
|  **Hold customer or agent**  |  Places a customer or agent on or off hold\.  |  Settings: Agent on hold / customer on call Customer on hold / agent on call Agent and customer on call  | 
| **Call phone number** | Initiates an outbound call from an outbound whisper flow\. | Use the **Call phone number** block to place an outbound call\. This block is supported only in outbound whisper flows\. You can optionally set the phone number displayed as the caller ID number to a number from your instance, or to a number using an attribute\. The number must be in E\.164 format\. | 
| **Start media streaming** | Starts capturing customer audio for a contact\. | Captures customer audio during a contact\. You must enable Live media streaming to successfully capture customer audio\. Media streaming continues until a **Stop media streaming** block is used or the contact ends\. To learn more, see [Use Live Media Streaming in a Contact Flow](customer-voice-streams.md)\. | 
| **Stop media streaming** | Stops capturing customer audio after it is started with a **Start media streaming** block\. | Once started, media streaming continues, even when one contact flow transfer to another contact flow\. You must use a **Stop media streaming** block to stop media streaming\. | 

### Set<a name="contact-set"></a>


| Block | Action | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  **Set working queue**  |  Specifies the queue to be used when **Transfer to queue** is invoked\.  |  A queue must be specified before invoking **Transfer to queue** except when used in a customer queue flow\. It’s also the default queue for checking attributes, such as staffing, queue status, and hours of operation\. To use a **Set working queue** block to set the queue dynamically, such as with contact attributes, you must specify the ARN for the queue rather than the queue name\. To find the ARN for a queue, open the queue in the queue editor\. The ARN is included as the last part of the URL displayed in the browser address bar after /queue\. For example, `.../queue/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-111111111111`\.   | 
|  **Set call recording behavior**  |  Sets options for call recordings\.  |  Enables or disables call recording for the agent, customer, or both\.  | 
|  **Set contact attributes**  |  Stores key\-value pairs as contact attributes\.  |  Contact attributes are accessible by other areas of Amazon Connect, such as the CCP and CTRs\.  | 
| Get queue metrics | Retrieves real\-time metrics about queues and agents in your contact center and returns them as attributes\. | Use a Check contact attributes block to check metric values and define routing logic based on them, such as number of contact in a queue, number of available agents, and oldest contact in a queue\. For more information, see [Using System Metric Attributes](contact-attributes.md#attrib-system-metrics)\. | 
|  **Change routing priority / age**  |  Alters the priority of the contact in queue\.  |  Routing age alters the time in queue for the contact, which determines its priority in comparison to when other contacts are received\. Queue priority sets the contact to a high priority that can be compared to other contacts that have a priority set \(typically between 1 and 1000\)\.  | 
|  **Set hold flow**  |  Links from one contact flow type to another\.  |  Specifies the flow to invoke when a customer or agent is put on hold\.  | 
|  **Set whisper flow**  |  Overrides the default whisper by linking to a whisper flow\.  |  Specifies the whisper to be played to customer on an outbound call, or to the customer or agent when the call is joined\.  | 
|  **Set callback number**  |  Sets a callback number\.  |  Specifies the number to be used to call the customer back in the CCP, or when **Transfer to queue** is invoked with the callback option\. When specifying a phone number in Amazon Connect, the number must be in [E\.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164)\. Numbers in E\.164 format do not include the leading zeroes you would dial for a local or regional call within the same country when dialing the number from a phone\. For example, if you usually dial 0400xxxxxx to place a call in Australia, the number in E\.164 format includes the country code of 61 and removes the leading zero for the number\. The number to use in Amazon Connect is **\+61400xxxxxx**\.  | 
|  **Set voice**  |  Sets the voice\.  |  Sets the voice to interact with the customer, and optionally the voice if using text\-to\-speech \(TTS\)\.  | 
|  **Set customer queue flow**  |  Set queue flow\.  |  Specifies the flow to invoke when a customer is transferred to a queue\.  | 

### Integrate<a name="contact-integrate"></a>


| Block | Action | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  **Invoke AWS Lambda function**  |  Makes a call to AWS Lambda, and optionally returns key\-value pairs\.  |  The returned key\-value pairs can be used to set contact attributes\.  | 

### Branch<a name="contact-branch"></a>


| Block | Action | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  **Check queue status**  |  Checks the status of the queue based on specified conditions\.  |  Branches based on the comparison of **Time in Queue** or **Queue capacity**\. If no match is found, the **No Match** branch is followed\.  | 
|  **Check staffing**  |  Checks the current working queue, or queue you specify in the block, for whether agents are available, staffed \(on call, or after call work status\), or online\.  |  Branches based on whether agents are available, staffed \(available, on call, and after call work\), or online\.  You must set a queue before using a **Check staffing** block in your contact flow\. If a queue is not set, the block always proceeds through the error branch\. You can use a **Set working queue** block to set the queue\. When a contact is transferred from one flow to another, the queue that is set in a contact flow is passed from that flow to the next flow\.   | 
|  **Check hours of operation**  |  Checks to see whether the contact is occurring within or outside of the hours of operation defined for the queue\.  |  Branches based on specified hours of operation, either directly or as associated to a queue that is within open hours\.   | 
|  **Check contact attributes**  |  Check the values of contact attributes\.  |  Branches based on a comparison to the value of a contact attribute\. Supported comparisons include: **Equals**, **Is Greater Than**, **Is Less Than**, **Starts With**, **Contains**\.  | 
|  **Distribute by percentage**  |  Routes customers randomly based on a percentage\.  |  Like flipping a coin, contacts are distributed randomly, which doesn’t guarantee exact percentage splits\.  | 
|  **Loop**  |   Loops through \(repeats\) the **Looping** branch for the number of loops specified\.  |   After the loops are completed, the **Complete** branch is followed\. If you enter 0 for the loop count, the **Complete** branch is followed the first time this block executes\.An example use of this block is to loop back to a **Get customer input** block to try to enter input, such as an account number, when an initial attempt does not succeed\.  | 

### Terminate / Transfer<a name="contact-terminate"></a>


| Block | Action | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  **Disconnect / hang up**  |  Terminates a customer contact\.  |  Disconnects the customer’s call\.  | 
|  **Transfer to queue**  |  In most contact flows, this block ends the current contact flow and places the customer in queue\. When used in a customer queue flow, this block transfers a call already in a queue to another queue\.  |  When used in most contact flows, a queue must be specified, using **Set working queue**, before invoking **Transfer to queue** except when used in a customer queue flow\. Optionally, the contact can be placed in queue to receive a callback, if a **Set customer callback number** block is used before this block in a flow\. When used in a customer queue flow, a **Loop prompts** block must be used prior to this block in the contact flow\. For more information, see [Using Queue to Queue Transfer](#queue-to-queue-transfer)\.  | 
|  **Transfer to phone number**  |  Transfers the customer\.  |  Ends the current contact flow and transfers the customer to a phone number\. If the country you want to select is not listed, you can submit a request to add countries you want to transfer calls to using the [Amazon Connect service limits increase form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-connect)\.  | 
|  **Transfer to agent**  |  Transfers the customer to an agent\.  |  Ends the current contact flow and transfers the customer to an agent\. If the agent is on a call, the contact is disconnected\.  | 
|  **Transfer to flow**  |  Transfers the customer to another contact flow\.  |  Ends the current contact flow and transfers the customer to a different contact flow\. Available in transfer to agent and transfer to queue flows\.  | 
|  **End flow / Resume**  |  Ends the current flow without disconnecting the caller\.  |  This can be used to return to a Loop prompts block when it has been interrupted\. When **End flow / Resume** is invoked, the customer remains connected to the system\.  | 

## Creating Contact Flows<a name="create-contact-flow"></a>

You can create a variety of contact flows in Amazon Connect, such as transfer flows and interruptible flows\. The starting point for all contact flows is the contact flow editor\. You can make your contact flows as simple or complex as necessary\.

**To create a new contact flow in Amazon Connect using the editor**

1. Choose **Routing**, **Contact flows**, **Create contact flow**\.

1. Type a name and a description for your contact flow\.

1. Search for a block using the **Search** bar, or expand the relevant group to locate the block\.

1. Drag and drop blocks onto the canvas\. They don't have to be added in a specific order or sequence, as connections between the elements do not have to be strictly linear\.

1. Select the block title to access the settings and editing menu\.

**To create connections between blocks**

1. Select the originating group\.

1. Select the circle for the action to perform\.

1. Drag the arrow to the connector of the group that performs the next action\.
**Note**  
For groups that support multiple branches, drag the connector to the appropriate action\.

1. Repeat the steps to create a contact flow that meets your requirements\.

1. Choose **Save** to save a draft of the flow\. Choose **Publish** to activate the flow immediately\.
**Note**  
All connectors must be connected to a block in order to successfully publish your contact flow\.

A saved contact flow cannot be assigned to a number until it is published\.

## Using a **Call phone number** block in a contact flow<a name="using-call-number-block"></a>

Use the **Call phone number** block in an outbound whisper flow to initiate an outbound call to a customer and, optionally, specify a custom caller ID number that is displayed to call recipients\. This is useful when you have multiple telephone numbers used to make outbound calls, but want to consistently display the same company phone number for the caller ID for calls made from your contact center\. You can also use the block to display a phone number for a specific line of business, or for displaying different numbers to customers based on their account type\.

When an outbound call is placed from your contact center, the number used to place the outbound call is the number selected as the **Outbound caller ID number** for the queue with which the outbound whisper flow is associated\. The caller ID number displayed to the call recipient is the number used to place the call\. In some cases, you may want to display a different number as the caller ID number for your organization\. For example, if you have customers in multiple geographic locations, you may want to display a number local to the area where your customers are\. Perhaps your organization has multiple lines of business serviced by a single set of agents, and want to display a different number from your instance for each line of business so that customers have the correct number to call back\.

When you use a **Call phone number** block in an outbound whisper flow, you can optionally set the caller ID number for outbound calls\. You can select any phone number from your instance, or use an attribute to set the number dynamically during the contact flow\. The attribute can be a user\-defined attribute you create using a **Set contact attributes** block in the contact flow, or an external attribute returned from an AWS Lambda function\. When you use an attribute to set the number, the value of the attribute must be a phone number from your instance in E\.164 format\. If the number is not in E\.164 format, the number from the queue associated with the outbound whisper flow is used for the caller ID number\. If no number is set for the outbound caller ID number for the queue, the call attempt will fail\.

For more information about E\.164, see [Use E\.164 Format for Telephone Numbers](agentconsole-guide.md#international-calls-ccp)\.

The **Call phone number** block is supported only in outbound whisper flow contact flows\. Only published contact flows can be selected as the outbound whisper flow for a queue\.

### How it Works<a name="call-number-block-how-it-works"></a>

Outbound whisper flows execute in Amazon Connect immediately after an agent accepts the call during direct dial and callback scenarios\. When the contact flow executes, the caller ID number is set if one is specified in the **Call phone number** block\. If no caller ID is specified in the **Call phone number** block, the caller ID number defined for the queue is used when the call is placed\. When there is an error with a call that is initiated by the **Call phone number** block, the call is disconnected and the agent is placed in ACW status\.

### Specify a custom caller ID number using a **Call phone number** block

1. In Amazon Connect choose **Routing**, **Contact flows**\.

1. Choose the down arrow next to **Create contact flow**, and then choose **Create outbound whisper flow**\.

1. Add a **Call phone number** block to the flow, and connect the **Entry point** block to it\.

   The **Call phone number** block must be placed before a **Play prompt** block if one is included in your contact flow\.

1. Select the **Call phone number** block, and then select **Caller ID number to display**\.

1. Do one of the following:
   + To use a number from your instance, choose **Select a number from your instance**, and then search for or select the number to use from the drop\-down\.
   + Choose **Use attribute** to use a contact attribute to provide the value for the caller ID number\. You can use either a **User Defined** attribute you create using a **Set contact attributes** block, or an **External** attribute returned from an AWS Lambda function\. The value of any attribute you use must be a phone number claimed for your instance and be in E\.164 format\. If the number used from an attribute is not in E\.164 format, the number set for the **Outbound caller ID number** for the queue is used\.

1. Add any additional blocks to complete your contact flow, and connect the **Success** branch of the **Call phone number** block to the next block in the flow\. Note that there is no error branch for the block\. If a call is not successfully initiated, the contact flow ends and the agent is placed in ACW state\.

## Using Queue to Queue Transfer<a name="queue-to-queue-transfer"></a>

For calls coming into your contact center, you can define advanced routing decisions to minimize queue wait times, or route calls to specific queues, using blocks in your contact flow\. For example, use a **Check queue status** block to check staffing or agent availability for a queue before sending a call to that queue, or use a **Get queue metrics** block to retrieve queue metrics\. Then use a **Check contact attributes** block to check specific queue metric attributes, and define conditions in the block to determine which queue to route the call to based on attribute values\. For more information about using queue metrics, see [Using System Metric Attributes](contact-attributes.md#attrib-system-metrics)\.

After determining which queue to transfer the call to, use a **Transfer to queue** block in a contact flow to transfer the call to that queue\. When the **Transfer to queue** block runs, it checks the queue capacity to determine whether or not the queue is at capacity \(full\)\. This check for queue capacity compares the current number of calls in the queue to the **Maximum contacts in queue** limit, if one is set for the queue\. If no limit is set, the queue is limited to the number of concurrent active calls set in the service limit for the instance\.

Once the call is placed in a queue, the call remains there until an agent takes the call, or until the call is handled based on the routing decisions in your customer queue flow\. To change the queue associated with the call after it is already placed in a queue, use a **Loop prompts** block with a **Transfer to queue** block in a customer queue flow\. In the block choose which queue to transfer the call to, or use an attribute to set the queue\.

In the **Transfer to queue** block, there are two outputs to route calls through: the **Success** branch or the **At capacity** branch\. When a call is successfully transferred to a queue and follows the **Success** branch, the call remains associated with the current customer queue flow after being transferred\. When the call is not successfully transferred to a queue and follows the **At capacity** branch because the queue is at capacity, the call remains in the current working queue\.

## Using a Transfer to queue block to manage calls in a queue

1. In Amazon Connect, choose **Routing**, **Contact flows**\.

1. Choose the down arrow next to **Create contact flow**, then choose **Create customer queue flow**\.

1. Under **Interact**, add a **Loop prompts** block to provide a message to the caller when the call is transferred, then every X seconds or minutes while the call is in the queue\.

1. Select the **Loop prompts** block to display the settings for the block\.

1. Choose **Add another prompt to the loop**\.

1. Under **Prompts**, do one of the following:
   + Choose **Audio recording** in the drop\-down menu, then select the audio recording to use as the prompt\.
   + Choose **Text to Speech** in the drop\-down menu, then enter text to use for the prompt in the **Enter text to be spoken** field\.

1. To set an interrupt, choose the **Interrupt every** check box, then enter a value for the interrupt interval, and then choose a unit, either **Minutes** or **Seconds**\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

1. Connect the block to the **Entry point** block in the contact flow\.

1. Under **Terminate/Transfer**, drag a **Transfer to queue** block onto the designer\.

1. Select the title of the block to display the settings for the block, then choose the **Transfer to queue** tab\.

1. Under **Queue to check**, choose **Select a queue**, then select the queue to transfer calls to\.

   Alternatively, choose **Use attribute**, then reference an attribute to specify the queue\. If you use an attribute to set the queue, the value must be the queue ARN\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

1. Connect the **Loop prompt** block to the **Transfer to queue** block\.

1. Add additional blocks to complete the contact flow that you require, such as the blocks to check queue status or metrics, then choose **Save**\.

   The contact flow is not active until you publish it\.

**Important**  
To successfully complete the call transfer to another queue, you must include a block after the **Transfer to queue** block and connect the **Success** branch to it\. For example, use an **End flow / Resume** block to end the contact flow\. The flow does not end until the call is picked up by an agent\.

## Transferring Calls Directly to a Specific Agent<a name="transfer-to-agent"></a>

With agent queues, you can route calls directly to a specific agent\. This can allow you to provide a consistent customer experience for your customers by letting you route calls directly to the agent the customer last interacted with if that agent is available\. In each block that supports transferring the contact to a queue, such as the **Transfer to queue** block, there is a **By agent** radio button under **Queue** \(or **Queue to check \(optional\)** or **By queue** depending on the block\)\. When you select **By agent**, a drop\-down list that includes all of the users in your instance is displayed\. When you select a user name, the contact is transferred to the queue for that user\.

Contact flow blocks in which you can specify a queue include: **Set working queue**, **Get queue metrics**, **Check queue status**, **Check staffing**, and **Transfer to queue** when used in a customer queue flow\.

**Note**  
A queue is created for all users in your Amazon Connect instance, but only users assigned permissions to use the Contact Control Panel \(CCP\) can use the CCP to receive calls\. The Agent or Admin security profiles are the only default security profiles that include permissions to use the CCP\. If you route a call to a user that cannot access the CCP, the contact can never be answered\.

**To route a call directly to a specific agent**

1. In Amazon Connect, choose **Routing**, **Contact flows**\.

1. In the **Contact flow designer**, open an existing, or create a new contact flow\.

1. Add a block in which you can select a queue to transfer a contact to, such as a **Set working queue** block\.

1. Select the title of the block to open the block settings\.

1. Select **By agent**\.

1. Under **Select an agent**, enter the user name of the agent, or select the agent's user name from the drop\-down list\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

1. Connect the **Success** branch to the next block in your contact flow\.

You can also choose to use an attribute to select the queue created for the agent user account\. To do so, after you choose **By agent**, choose **Use attribute**\.

### Using Contact Attributes to Route Contacts to a Specific Agent<a name="use-attribs-agent-queue"></a>

When you use a contact attributes in a contact flow to route calls to an agent, the attribute value must be either the agent's user name, or the agent's user ID\.

To determine the user ID for an agent so that you can use the value as an attribute, you can use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ListUsers.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ListUsers.html) operation to retrieve the users from your instance\. The each agent's user ID is returned with the results from the operation as the value of the `Id` in the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_UserSummary.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_UserSummary.html) object\.

You can also find the directory user ID for an agent by using [Agent Event Streams](agent-event-streams.md)\. The agent events included in the agent event data stream includes the agent ARN, and the directory user ID is included in the agent ARN after `agent/`\. In the following example agent event data, the agent ID is **87654321\-4321\-4321\-4321\-123456789012**\.

```

## Contact Flow Logs<a name="contact-flow-logs"></a>

Amazon Connect contact flow logs provide you with real\-time details about events in your contact flows as customers interact with them\. You can use contact flow logs to help debug your contact flows as you are creating them\. After you publish your contact flows, you can view the logs to gain insight into what happens during complex contact flows, and quickly identify errors that your customers encounter when they connect to your contact center\.

Contact flow logs are stored in Amazon CloudWatch, in the same region as your Amazon Connect instance\. A log entry added as each block in your contact flow is triggered\. You can configure CloudWatch to send alerts when unexpected events occur during active contact flows\. As a contact center manager, you can aggregate data from contact flow logs to analyze performance of contact flows to optimize the experience you provide for your customers\. For more information about CloudWatch Logs, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/)\.

### Enabling Contact Flow Logs<a name="contact-flow-log-entries"></a>

To start generating contact flow logs, enable contact flow logs for your Amazon Connect instance\. After you enable logs for your instance, logs are generated only for contact flows that include a **Set logging behavior** block with logging set to enabled\. You can control which flows, or parts of flows, logs are generated for by including multiple **Set logging behavior** blocks and setting logging to enabled or disabled as desired\. When you use a **Set logging behavior** block to enable or disable logging for a flow, logging is also enabled or disabled for any subsequent flow that a contact is transferred to, even if the flow does not include a **Set logging behavior** block\. To avoid having logging settings persist between flows, you should include a **Set logging behavior** block in the flow with logging enabled or disabled as desired for that specific flow\.

When you create a new Amazon Connect instance, you can enable Contact flow logs when you configure Data Storage settings\. If you already have an Amazon Connect instance, you can enable or disable Contact flow logs for your instance in the Amazon Connect console under **Contact flow** settings\. You are not charged for generating contact flow logs, but are charged for using CloudWatch for generating and storing the logs\. Free tier customers are charged only for usage that exceeds service limits\. For details about Amazon CloudWatch pricing, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/)\.

**To enable contact flow logs for your Amazon Connect instance**

1. Open the Amazon Connect console\.

1. Choose the instance alias for the instance for which to enable contact flow logs\.

1. Choose **Contact flows**\.

1. Select **Enable Contact flow logs** and choose **Apply**\.

After you enable contact flow logs for your instance, you can enable logging for a flow by adding a **Set logging behavior** block\.

**To enable or disable contact flow logs for a contact flow**

1. Add a **Set logging behavior** block and connect it to another block in the flow\.

1. Open the settings for the block, and under **Logging behavior** do one of the following:

   Select **Enable** to turn on logging for the flow\.

   Select **Disable** to turn off logging for the flow\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

1. If you add a **Set logging behavior** block to a contact flow that is already published, you must publish it again to start generating logs for it\.

### Data Captured in Contact Flow Logs<a name="contact-flow-log-data"></a>

Log entries for contact flows include details about the block associated with the log entry, the contact ID, and the action taken after the steps in the block were completed\. Any contact interaction that occurs outside of the contact flow is not logged, such as time spent in a queue or interactions with an agent\. You can control which data is captured in contact flow logs by including a **Set logging behavior** block in your contact flow\. You can set the properties of the block to disable logging during the parts of your contact flow that interact with or capture sensitive data or customers’ personal information\.

If you use Amazon Lex or AWS Lambda in your contact flows, the logs show the entry and exit of the contact flow going to them, and include any information about the interaction that is sent or received during entry or exit\.

Because the logs also include the contact flow ID, and the contact flow ID stays the same when you change a contact flow, you can use the logs to compare the interactions with different versions of the contact flow\.

The following example log entry shows a Set queue block of a customer queue flow\.

```
{
    "Timestamp": "2017-11-09T12:17.898Z",
    "ContactId": "f0b21968-952b-47ba-b764-f29a57bcf626",
    "ContactFlowId": "arn:aws:connect:us-east-2:0123456789012:instance/d-92673ef055/contact-flow/b1d791cf-1264-42e3-9a73-62cbcb3c9a45",
    "ContactFlowModuleType": "SetQueue",
    "Events": {
        "Queue": [
            "arn:aws:connect:us-east-2:670047220557:instance/d-92673ef044/queue/f0300e43-9547-477c-b8ba-0bb7a72f7fa1"
        ]
    }
}
```

### Tracking Customers Between Contact Flows<a name="contact-flow-log-multiple-flows"></a>

In many cases, customer contacts interact with multiple contact flows in your call center, being passed from one contact flow to another to appropriately assist them with their specific issue\. Contact flow logs help you track customers between different contact flows, by including the ID of the contact in each log entry\. When a customer is transferred to a different contact flow, the ID for the contact associated with their interaction is included with the log for the new flow\. You can query the logs for the contact ID to trace the customer interaction through each contact flow\. In larger, high\-volume contact centers, there can be multiple streams for contact flow logs\. If a contact is transferred to a different contact flow, the log may be in a different stream\. To make sure that you are finding all of the log data for a specific contact, you should search for the contact ID in the entire CloudWatch log group instead of in a specific log stream\.

### Create Alerts for Contact Flow Log Events<a name="contact-flow-log-alerts"></a>

You can configure CloudWatch to define a filter pattern that looks for specific events in your contact flow logs and then creates an alert when an entry for that event is added to the log\. For example, you can set an alert for when a contact flow block goes down an error path as a customer interacts with the flow\. Log entries are typically available in CloudWatch within a short time, giving you near real\-time notification of events in contact flows\.

### Analyzing Contact Flow Logs with Amazon Kinesis<a name="contact-flow-log-kinesis"></a>

To perform analysis on your contact flow logs, you can set up an Amazon Kinesis stream to stream your contact flow log data from CloudWatch to a data warehouse service, such as Amazon Redshift\. You can combine the contact flow log data with other Amazon Connect data in your warehouse, or run queries to identify trends or common issues with a contact flow\.

## Contact Flow Import/Export<a name="contact-flow-import-export"></a>

You can export contact flows from and import contact flows into your Amazon Connect instance\. You can use exported contact flows to create backup copies and manage version control of your contact flows\. This lets you easily restore a previous version in case you encounter an error with a published contact flow\. You can easily copy contact flows from one Amazon Connect instance to another, for example from a test environment to a production environment, or from one region to another as you expand your customer service organization\.

**Note**  
The Contact Flow Import/Export feature is currently in Beta status\. Updates and improvements that we make could result in issues in future releases importing contact flows that are exported during the beta phase\.

Because Amazon Connect contact flows are not tied to a specific instance or account, exported flows could also be imported into instances created by other customers, allowing Amazon Connect partners to create custom contact flow solutions that can be used by Amazon Connect customers\.

When you export a contact flow, the most recently saved version of the flow you currently have open in the Contact Flow editor is exported as a UTF\-8 encoded JSON document\. Each block of your contact flow is included in the JSON document as a separate section\. To import a contact flow, either one that you previous exported, or that was exported from a different Amazon Connect instance, you just select the JSON file and import it\. The imported flow replaces the contact flow currently open in the editor\. The imported contact flow is not added to your Amazon Connect instance until you save it after importing\.

### Resolving Resources in Imported Contact Flows<a name="contact-flow-export-resources"></a>

When you create a contact flow, the resources you include in the contact flow, such as queues and voice prompts, are referenced within the contact flow using the name of the resource and the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\)\. The ARN is a unique identifier for a resource that is specific to the service and region in which the resource is created\. When you export a contact flow, the name and ARN for each resource referenced in the contact flow is included in the exported contact flow\.

When you import a contact flow, Amazon Connect attempts to resolve the references to the Amazon Connect resources used in the contact flow, such as queues, by using the ARN for the resource\. When you import a contact flow into the same Amazon Connect instance that you exported it from, the resources used in the contact flow will resolve to the existing resources in that instance\. If you delete a resource, or change the permissions for a resource, Amazon Connect may not be able to resolve the resource when you import the contact flow\. When a resource cannot be found using the ARN, Amazon Connect attempts to resolve the resource by finding a resource with the same name as the one used in the contact flow\. If no resource with the same name is found, a warning is displayed on the block that contains a reference to the unresolved resource\.

If you import a contact flow into a different Amazon Connect instance than the one it was exported from, the ARNs for the resources used are different\. If you create resources in the instance with the same name as the resource in the instance where the contact flow was exported from, the resources can be resolved by name\. You can also open the blocks that contain unresolved resources, or resources that were resolved by name, and change the resource to another one in the Amazon Connect instance\. You can save a contact flow with unresolved or missing resources, but you cannot publish it until the resources are resolved or removed\.

### Exporting Contact Flows<a name="contact-flow-labels"></a>

When you export a contact flow, the JSON document created for the flow includes a section for each block in the flow\. The name used for a specific block, parameter, or other element of the contact flow may be different than the label used for it in the user interface \(UI\)\.

By default, contact flow export files are created without a file name extension, and saved to the default location set for your browser\. We suggest saving your exported contact flows to folder that contains only exported contact flows\.

**Important**  
When you attempt to import or export a large or complex contact flow, the export may fail if the contact flow contains a large amount of blocks and resources\. It may also fail if the file size for the exported contact flow exceeds 1 MB in size\. An notification message is displayed when this occurs\.
