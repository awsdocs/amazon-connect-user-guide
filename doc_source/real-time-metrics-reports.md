# Real\-time Metrics Reports<a name="real-time-metrics-reports"></a>

Real\-time metrics reports show real\-time or near\-real time metrics information about activity in your contact center\. Metrics such as **Online** show the number of agents currently online in real\-time, updating every 15 seconds\. Metrics such as **Handled** and **Abandoned** reflect near real\-time values for your contact center\. Data in Real\-time reports is refreshed as follows:
+ The report page updates every 15 seconds\.
+ Metrics such as **Active** and **Availability** update as activity occurs, with a small system delay for processing the activity\.
+ Agent near real\-time metrics, such as **Missed** and **Occupancy**, update every 5 minutes\.
+ Contact near real\-time metrics update about 1 minute after a contact ends\.

Report templates are included for **Queues**, **Agents**, and **Routing profiles**\. You can also customize each of the report types, specify a time range for the report, and select filters for fields to include or exclude from the report\. You can add additional reports, or display multiple versions of the same report type, and customize each to include different information or a different time range\. Updating one report does not affect the other reports displayed on the report page\. When you create a real\-time metrics report, it is displayed on the Real\-time metrics page, and updates automatically to show current activity in your contact center\.

## Types of Real\-time Metrics Reports<a name="types-real-time-reports"></a>

You can create the following types of real\-time metrics reports in Amazon Connect\.

**Queues**  
Queues reports show contact data grouped by queue\. For each contact that occurred during the report time range, the queue in which the contact was handled is displayed with metrics about Agent and Performance\. When you create a Queues report, the first column in the report table is Queues, and the data in the table is data for the queue\. You can view the routing profile associated with the queue by selecting the arrow next to the queue name\.

If you choose the view agents icon next to the routing profile, a report table for the routing profile is added to the page\.

**Agents**  
Agents reports show data about agents currently online in to your contact center, grouped by agent\. Only agents with a status of **Online** are included\. When you create an Agents report, the first column in the report is the **Agent Login**, which is the agent’s user name used to log in to Amazon Connect\. The data in the report includes metrics for **Agent**, **Phone**, and **Performance**\.

**Routing profiles**  
Routing Profiles reports display data about activity in your contact center grouped by routing profile, and includes metrics for Agents and Performance\.
