# Agent Event Streams<a name="agent-event-streams"></a>

Amazon Connect agent event streams are Amazon Kinesis data streams that provide you with near real\-time reporting of agent activity within your Amazon Connect instance\. The events published to the stream include agent login, agent logout, agent answers a call, and agent status change\.

You can use the agent event streams to create dashboards that display agent information and events, integrate streams into workforce management \(WFM\) solutions, and configure alerting tools to trigger custom notifications of specific agent activity\. Agent event streams help you manage agent staffing and efficiency\.

## Enabling Agent Event Streams<a name="agent-event-streams-enable"></a>

Agent event streams are not enabled by default\. Before you can enable agent event streams in Amazon Connect, create a data stream in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams\. Then, choose the Kinesis stream as the stream to use for agent event streams\. Though you can use the same stream for both agent event streams and contact trace records, managing and getting data from the stream is much easier when you use a separate stream for each\. For more information, see the [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/)\.

When data is sent to Kinesis, the partition key used is the agent ARN\. All events for a single agent are sent to the same shard, and any resharding events in the stream are ignored\.

**Note**  
If you enable server\-side encryption for the Kinesis stream you select for agent event streams, Amazon Connect cannot publish to the stream because it does not have permission to Kinesis kms:GenerateDataKey\. To work\-around this, enable encryption for call recordings or scheduled reports, create a customer master key \(CMK\) using KMS to use for encryption, and then choose the same CMK for your Kinesis data stream that you use for call recording or scheduled reports encryption so that Amazon Connect has appropriate permissions to encrypt data sent to Kinesis\. To learn more about creating a customer master key \(CMK\) KMS key, see [Creating Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html)\.

**To enable agent event streams**

1. Open the Amazon Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/connect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/)\.

1. On the console, choose the name in the **Instance Alias** column of the instance for which to enable agent event streams\.

1. Choose **Data streaming**, then select **Enable data streaming**\.

1. Under **Agent Events**, select the Kinesis stream to use, and then choose **Save**\.

## Use Agent Event Streams to Determine Agent ACW Time<a name="determine-acw-time"></a>

You can use agent event stream data to determine the amount of time an agent spent in ACW\. Though there is no event in the event stream for the agent entering AWS status, you can use the other agent event data to calculate the time\.

In agent event streams, you can determine the time at which an agent entered ACW status by viewing the `StateStartTimeStamp` for the event for a contact entering the `ENDED` state in the event stream\.

For example, in the following example agent event stream output, the agent enters ACW at "**StateStartTimestamp**": "2018\-10\-25T18:55:27\.027Z"\.

Agent ACW state ends when the agent enters another state, such as when the agent chooses a status in the CCP\. To determine the time at which an agent left ACW status, you can view the `EventTimeStamp` for the `EventType` "STATE\_CHANGE" in the stream output\. Note that a STATE\_CHANGE event also occurs when the agent's configuration is changed, such as the routing profile assigned to the agent\. To confirm that you are using the correct `EventTimeStamp` associated with the agent leaving ACW status, use the `EventTimeStamp` for the event where the associated `CurrentAgentSnapshot` has no contacts listed, and the state for the contact listed in the `PreviousAgentSnapshot` equals ENDED\.

For example, in the following example agent event stream file, the agent left ACW at "**EventTimestamp**": "2018\-10\-25T18:55:32\.032Z"\.
